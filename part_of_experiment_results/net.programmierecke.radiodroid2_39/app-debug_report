Exception: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Fragment FragmentTabs{ad2d8a28} not attached to Activity

Category: Lifecycle

Root cause: Class "net.programmierecke.radiodroid2.FragmentTabs$1" starts a new thread via "java.lang.Object" and tries to get resources in Fragment "net.programmierecke.radiodroid2.FragmentTabs$ViewPagerAdapter" from Activity, however, the fragment is detached from the Activity before the background thread finished, throwing such exception.

Description: When doing time-consuming operation in background thread(e.g, AsyncTask), a new Fragment has been created in the meantime, and was detached to the Activity before the AsyncTask finished. The code in UI thread(e.g.,onPostExecute) calls upon a detached Fragment, throwing such exception.
 

Fix solution: 

    1: Cancel the background thread when pausing or stopping the Fragment

    2: Use isAdded() to check whether the fragment is attached and then to getResources() from activity.
