Exception: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Fragment DetectorTaskFragment{ad33ff98} not attached to Activity

Category: Lifecycle

Description: When doing time-consuming operation in background thread(e.g, AsyncTask), a new Fragment has been created in the meantime, and was detached to the Activity before the AsyncTask finished. The code in UI thread(e.g.,onPostExecute) calls upon a detached Fragment, throwing such exception.
 

Fix solution: 

    1: Cancel the background thread when pausing or stopping the Fragment

    2: Use isAdded() to check whether the fragment is attached and then to getResources() from activity.
