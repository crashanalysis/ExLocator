Exception: BadTokenException: Unable to add window -- token android.os.BinderProxy@afec0378 is not valid

Category: Lifecycle

Root cause: Activity/Fragment "com.twofours.surespot.ui.MultiProgressDialog$1" started a new thread via "java.lang.Runnable", and try to show a dialog in the new thread when the activity is finished.

Description: The activity has finished but you are trying to display a dialog with a context of the finished activity. Since there is no window for the dialog to display the android runtime throws this exception.

Fix solution: 

    1: Use isFinishing() method which is called by Android to check whether this activity is in the process of finishing: be it explicit finish() call or activity clean up made by Android.
